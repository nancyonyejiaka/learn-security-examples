### Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
The insecure version of the system does not properly sanitized and validate user inputs. As a
result, the system always assumes the user input is a String, when in reality, it could
be code snippets or scripts that could be injected into the server-side system and expose 
sensitive data.


The secure version of the system prevents the vulnerability by converting the user input into
Strings. This involved removing special characters and replacing them with their String equivalents, 
which would prevent the script or code snippets from being injected into the server-side.


### Which CIA property does tampering violate?
Tampering violates the CIA property of integrity. Cross-site scripting attacks (XSS), change and
corrupt the data in the system when attacker-run inputs are not properly sanitized and allowed to execute.
