### Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.

The insecure version of the system takes in a userId and the newRole for the user. This means
that attackers can enter the userId of a admin and downgrade their role to a regular user.

The secure version of the system user the userId that is provided by the session, instead of
an Id coming directly from the user. This ensures that the role update only happens if there
is a valid session that we trust.


### What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?

We can define the endpoint in a way that only admin users can access it.

We can also incorporate 2FA so that the data is verified not only by the session id
but also by the token.
