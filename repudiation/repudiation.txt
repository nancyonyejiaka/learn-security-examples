### Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version is better at preventing 
repudiation than the insecure version.

The insecure version of the system has no way of associating requests with the users that
performed them.

The secure version of the system includes middleware for logging requests. For each incoming
request, the middleware will log the date, method, url, and id for the each request. These
logs are added to a files that is secure and private. If the action of writing the error to
the log fails, there is also middleware for handling errors. This ensures that there are no
denial of service concerns.


### What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?

Instead of storing the logs in the file system, we should store in mongoDB. This ensures
the logs are accessible, but means it may take more time to access the logs and decrease
the performance of the system.

We could also incorporate audit policies that find patterns in the logs and could point out
any potential issues with endpoints.
