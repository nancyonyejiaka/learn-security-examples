### Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
The insecure version of the system executed a findOne query baded on the id field. This id
comes directly from user input, which could potentially be an attack.

The secure version add error handling to catch errors that are thrown by the query, rather
than letting invalid inputs crash the system.

### What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?
We should also sanitize the user input, even if mongoDB already has safeguards for the id field.

We should also incorporate rate-limiting middleware to limit requests that come to the server
for a specific period of time.
