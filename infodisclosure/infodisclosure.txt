### Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.

The insecure version of the system is vulnerable to NoSQL injection attacks. The database of
users is queried based on unsanitized user input via the username. This allows malicious users
to input scripts that could reveal sensitive information in the database.

The secure version sanitizes the input before running it in the database.


### Which CIA property does tampering violate?
This violates the property of confidentiality. When the NoSQL injections are run, sensitive
information from the database is revealed.

This violates the property of availability because the NoSQL injection could result in the deletion
of data, which would make it unavailable to users when they need it.

### What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate?
We could also incorporate protective measure of the the database, which would protect it from
NoSQL injections.
